## Assignment

Using your credit card form assignment as a reference, change over components to be functional components and manage state through hooks.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; padding: 10px 0;">
<img src="images/credit_card_form.png" alt="credit card example" width="350"/>
</div> 

## Deliverable

1. All class components should be replaced with functional components.
2. All state management should be done through hooks, so remove all references to `setState`
3. Should support same features as before: show amount being charged, submit button, and all fields that are required to submit credit card should be editable.
